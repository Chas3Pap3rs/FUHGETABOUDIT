# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


* Chase Poulton

* A simple GTA/Mobster themed To-Do List (task manager) with a fun puzzle aspect for gaining access.
    - fuhgetaboudit.net

* Use details and functionality: Access the todo-list, if you can. If you ain't "made" (ie: part of the family) then    you're a rat. Tasks and related states save locally, you must know the passphrase to access the "To-Do" list. 

* Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JS, React, Vite, React Router, Drag and Drop, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, CDN Fonts, and Font Awesome.

* Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3)
    1. Improve drag and drop feature, along with audio details (clips) that play when a card is dropped (with the ability to mute all audio on page)
    2. Add more security to the passphrase and todo-list page so that the passphrase can't be found or bypassed to access the todo-list page
    3. Add more features like different view options, time and date deadlines on tasks that have visual effects (and backend data) that automate's these state changes if the task is not completed in time.
